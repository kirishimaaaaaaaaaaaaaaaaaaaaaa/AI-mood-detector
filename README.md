# 🕵️‍♀️ Sentiment Spy

**Sentiment Spy** is a fun and interactive Python program that analyzes the *sentiment* of your sentences — whether they are **Positive**, **Negative**, or **Neutral** — using colorful output and emojis! 🎨😊  
Built using `TextBlob` and `Colorama` during my second Codingal class. 🚀
